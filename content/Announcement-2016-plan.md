###OpenStack India Online Meetup 2016 Plans

Greetings,

Hello On behalf of OpenStack India Online, I would like to wish you very Happy New Year 2016!

The plan in 2016 is to get started with Introduction to OpenStack components. This will include

- Introduction sessions from contributors
- Demos

I would like all interested in to registered for their patience. The meetup series will start in couple of weeks once I get the available time-slots and content confirmed from speakers. Stay tuned for updates.
