#Announcement: OpenStack India Online Meetup


Greetings,


It gives me immense pleasure to announce a well deserved **Online Meetup**
place for all OpenStack community members in India. With the ever growing
participation to use, evaluate and contribute to OpenStack, the community
in India is growing at a very fast pace. With the large geographical
diversity of physical meetup places (and travel costs involved for
attending meetups), there needs a mechanism for all to collaborate, share
our ideas and a place to look at if we miss anything with all the real
world complexities involved.

I hereby invite everyone interested to share any tini-tiny bit they want to
community members to know to join us at the URL provided below with their
interest and we will make sure there will be event scheduled for you to
collaborate with those who are interested.

Feel free to shoot direct mail to the mail <openstackindiaonline at gmail.com>
with any suggesions/queries you might have.
