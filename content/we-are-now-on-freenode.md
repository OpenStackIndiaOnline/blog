Summary: We are now on Freenode with #openstackindia

Greetings,

We are making baby steps in starting the OpenStack India Online Meetup series and one of the important part of it is to collaborate with each other to get the best out of what we can.

To facilitate this we have created an IRC channel [#openstackindia](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openstackindia) for everyone to join.

Please drop by and say hello!

####We all #love #OpenStack. Lets make the community stronger.
